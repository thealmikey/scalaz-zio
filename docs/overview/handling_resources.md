title:  "Handling Resources"
---

This section looks at some of the common ways to safely handle resources using ZIO.

ZIO's resource management features work across synchronous, asynchronous, concurrent, and other effect types, and provide strong guarantees even in the presence of unexpected errors or defects in the application.

```scala mdoc:invisible
import scalaz.zio._
```

## Finalizing

ZIO provides similar functionality to `try` / `finally` with the `ZIO#ensuring` method. 

Like `try` / `finally`, the `ensuring` operation guarantees that if an effect begins executing, then the finalizer will begin executing, even if the first effect fails.

```scala mdoc
val finalizer = 
  UIO.effectTotal(println("Finalizing!"))

val finalized: IO[String, Unit] = 
  IO.fail("Failed!").ensuring(finalizer)
```

The finalizer is not allowed to fail, which means that it must handle any errors. 

Like `try` / `finally`, finalizers can be nested, and the failure of any inner finalizer will not affect outer finalizers.

Unlike `try` / `finally`, `ensuring` works across all types of effects, including asynchronous and concurrent effects.

## Bracket 

A common use for `try` / `finally` is safely acquiring and releasing resources, such as opened sockets or files:

```scala 
val handle = openFile(name)

try {
  ...
} finally closeFile(handle)
```

ZIO provides encapsulates this common pattern with `ZIO#bracket`, which allows you to specify an _acquire_ effect, which acquires a resource; a _release_ effect, which releases it; and a _use_ effect, which uses the resource.

The release effect is guaranteed to be executed by the runtime system, even in the presence of errors or interruption.

```scala mdoc:invisible
import scalaz.zio._
import java.io.{ File, IOException }

def openFile(s: String): IO[IOException, File] = IO.succeedLazy(???)
def closeFile(f: File): UIO[Unit] = IO.succeedLazy(???)
def decodeData(f: File): IO[IOException, Unit] = IO.unit
def groupData(u: Unit): IO[IOException, Unit] = IO.unit
```

```scala mdoc:silent
val groupedFileData: IO[IOException, Unit] = openFile("data.json").bracket(closeFile(_)) { file =>
  for {
    data    <- decodeData(file)
    grouped <- groupData(data)
  } yield grouped
}
```

Like `ensuring`, brackets have compositional semantics, so if one bracket is nested inside another bracket, and the outer bracket acquires a resource, then the outer bracket's release will always be called, even if, for example, the inner bracket's release fails.
